## Server-side api

This project provides a server-side nodejs API that contains the endpoint to retrieve the list of 1000 movies. 

To start the service API, you need to run:

    yarn start

and use the url: `http://localhost:8080/api/movies` to request the movie list.

## Additional information

The server API is built on top of the https://github.com/typicode/json-server library. This library offers many features like filtering, sorting and paging.

Good luck!
